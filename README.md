# Bilingual Translation English-to-Newari and Newari-to-English

This is a simple translation model for translating english to newari and newari to english. It uses seq2seq network. The repo contains dataset that me and my team collected by ourselves for the Nepal's first linguistic Hackathon. It also has vocabs and the models.

You can simply clone it and install the requirements.txt if you want to try it.
